### Introduction

Understanding spending patterns is crucial for businesses, financial institutions, and individuals. This repository provides a machine learning pipeline that enables you to predict spending patterns based on historical data. By analyzing spending patterns, you can gain insights into consumer behavior, identify anomalies, and make informed decisions.

Installation
To get started, follow these steps to set up the project environment:

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/predicting-spending-patterns.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd predicting-spending-patterns
Install the required dependencies by running:
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Once you have installed the necessary dependencies, you can start using the pipeline to predict spending patterns. Here's an overview of the main steps involved:

Data Preparation: Preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and normalize the data.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset to improve model performance.
Model Training: Train a machine learning model using the prepared dataset.
Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data points.
Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.
Visualization: Generate interactive visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib to gain insights into the spending patterns.
Feel free to customize the pipeline according to your specific needs and dataset.

Data
To use this pipeline, you need a dataset containing historical spending data. The dataset should include relevant features such as transaction amounts, dates, categories, and any other information that might be useful for predicting spending patterns. Ensure that the dataset is in a compatible format (e.g., CSV, JSON) and update the necessary file paths in the code.

Pipeline Overview
The pipeline consists of several modules that work together to predict spending patterns. Each module performs a specific task, and the output of one module serves as the input to the next. Here's a high-level overview of the pipeline:

Data Loading: Load the dataset into memory for further processing.
Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset by handling missing values and removing irrelevant data.
Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the dataset by normalizing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting into training and test sets.
Feature Engineering: Perform feature extraction and selection to improve model performance.
Model Training: Train a machine learning model on the prepared dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics.
Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data points.
Visualization: Create interactive visualizations using Plotly and Matplotlib to analyze spending patterns.
Data Visualization
This repository utilizes Plotly and Matplotlib to create rich and interactive visualizations. The visualizations can help you explore the dataset, identify trends, and gain insights into spending patterns. The code
